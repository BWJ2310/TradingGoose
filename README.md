  # TradingGoose
  
  **Frontend Repository**
  
  An intelligent trading platform powered by multiple AI agents that collaborate to analyze markets, manage portfolios, and execute trades with sophisticated risk management.
</div>

## Overview

This repository contains the **frontend application** for the TradingGoose project - a comprehensive trading system that leverages a swarm of specialized AI agents to provide institutional-grade market analysis and automated trading capabilities. The platform combines fundamental analysis, technical indicators, news sentiment, and social media signals to make informed trading decisions.

This project's multi-agent analysis workflow architecture is based on the [TauricResearch/TradingAgents](https://github.com/TauricResearch/TradingAgents) framework, which pioneered the concept of collaborative AI agents for financial analysis.

## Features

### ü§ñ Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Coordinator Agent**: Orchestrates analysis workflows and manages agent collaboration
- **Market Analyst**: Analyzes market trends and technical indicators
- **Fundamentals Analyst**: Evaluates company financials and valuation metrics
- **News Analyst**: Processes and interprets market news and events
- **Social Media Analyst**: Monitors social sentiment and trending topics
- **Risk Analysts** (Safe/Neutral/Risky): Provides multi-perspective risk assessments
- **Portfolio Manager**: Optimizes portfolio allocation and rebalancing
- **Trader Agent**: Executes trades based on collective intelligence

### üìä Core Capabilities
- **Real-time Market Analysis**: Continuous monitoring of stocks and market conditions
- **Multi-Stock Analysis**: Analyze multiple stocks simultaneously in a single workflow
- **Portfolio Management**: Comprehensive portfolio optimization with position sizing and allocation strategies
- **Scheduled Rebalancing**: Automated portfolio rebalancing on daily, weekly, or monthly schedules

- **Workflow Visualization**: Real-time tracking of analysis and decision-making processes
- **Historical Tracking**: Complete audit trail of analyses, trades, and rebalancing activities

### üîê Security & Access Control
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permission system with admin, moderator, and user roles
- **Secure Authentication**: Supabase-powered authentication with email verification
- **Invitation System**: Controlled user onboarding through admin-managed invitations
- **API Key Management**: Secure storage and management of trading API credentials

## Tech Stack

- **Customizable AI Providers** for agent intelligence (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and more)

## How It Works

### The Analysis Process

When you initiate a stock analysis, TradingGoose orchestrates a sophisticated multi-agent workflow:

1. **Data Gathering Phase**
   - Multiple data sources are queried simultaneously
   - Real-time market data, news, social sentiment, and fundamentals are collected
   - Historical patterns and technical indicators are analyzed

2. **Research & Debate Phase**
   - Bull Researcher agent presents positive evidence and growth potential
   - Bear Researcher agent identifies risks and presents cautionary analysis
   - Both perspectives are rigorously evaluated for balance

3. **Risk Assessment Phase**
   - Three specialized risk agents analyze from different perspectives:
     - **Safe Agent**: Conservative approach focusing on capital preservation
     - **Neutral Agent**: Balanced view weighing opportunities against risks
     - **Risky Agent**: Aggressive stance for high-growth potential

4. **Decision Synthesis**
   - Research Manager consolidates all agent insights
   - Risk Manager combines analyses with defined risk parameters
   - Portfolio Manager evaluates position sizing and portfolio impact

5. **Execution Ready**
   - Final recommendations are presented with confidence scores
   - Trade signals are generated based on collective intelligence
   - All analysis is logged for historical tracking

</div>

*Note: This workflow architecture is adapted from the [TauricResearch/TradingAgents](https://github.com/TauricResearch/TradingAgents) framework.*

### The Rebalancing Process

TradingGoose continuously monitors your portfolio and market conditions:

1. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Price movements are tracked against user-defined thresholds
   - Portfolio allocations are compared to target weights
   - Market conditions are evaluated for rebalancing opportunities

2. **Opportunity Detection**
   - When thresholds are exceeded, the Opportunity Agent activates
   - Stocks requiring attention are identified and prioritized
   - Market-wide screening identifies new potential positions

3. **Strategic Analysis**
   - Selected stocks undergo full multi-agent analysis
   - Current positions are evaluated for scaling or exit
   - New opportunities are assessed for entry

4. **Portfolio Optimization**
   - Target allocations are calculated based on risk tolerance
   - Rebalancing trades are proposed to achieve optimal weights
   - Tax implications and transaction costs are considered

5. **Execution Management**
   - Proposed changes are presented for review
   - Approved rebalancing is executed through connected brokers
   - Performance tracking begins immediately post-execution

## Usage

### Running an Analysis
1. Navigate to the Dashboard
2. Enter a stock ticker in the search bar
3. Click "Analyze" to trigger the multi-agent workflow
4. Monitor progress in real-time through the workflow visualization
5. Review comprehensive insights from all agents

### Portfolio Rebalancing
1. Go to Settings > Rebalancing
2. Configure rebalancing settings (position sizes, thresholds, frequency)
3. Schedule automatic rebalancing or trigger manually
4. Review proposed changes before execution
5. Track rebalancing history and performance
